- in express, for validation, follow 3 steps:
  - prepare custom validations
  - prepare a middleware for it
  - use the middleware in route to perform validations in the middleware step
    - in routes, instead of passing a reference of validation method, call the method immediately there bcz this method does not call `next()` so if we don't call it, then the reference won't gets transferred to the middleware.
